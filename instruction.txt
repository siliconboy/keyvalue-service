Instructions:

0. your environment must have JRE/JDK1.8.

1. start service using following command:
   java -jar keyvalue-service-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar server config.yml   

   note:  the service port will be 8082 in localhost.  server setting can be changed in config.yml file before you start service.
2. you may open keyvalue folder as a project in NetBean or Eclipse.  The project is based on DropWizard framework 1.0.
   source code is under mentioned folder.

3. some assumptions and missing parts:

  We assume that key must not have suffix "/callback". And once callback timeout, we ignore its validation.
  File KeyValues.dat is used as persistent store although it's not efficent.

  Current code does not fully handle 5 second response time limit except basic timeout.
